# Password-Generator
A password generator creates strong, random passwords using code. It uses letters, numbers, and symbols to enhance security. With if, else, and def, the program checks input length and generates a secure password. This helps protect accounts from hacking by making passwords difficult to guess or crack.
üîê Password Generator ‚Äì Project Description
A Password Generator is a program that automatically creates secure, random passwords. The goal is to help users protect their accounts and data by generating strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack. In this project, Python is used along with basic programming concepts like if, else, and def to create a simple yet powerful tool.

The generator prompts the user to enter the desired password length. It checks whether the input length is valid (typically at least 4 characters) using an if-else condition. If the length is valid, the program then ensures the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character to meet common security standards.

Using Python‚Äôs random and string modules, it builds the rest of the password by selecting random characters from all available options. Finally, the characters are shuffled to remove patterns and joined into a complete password string.
